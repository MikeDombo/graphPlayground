# Graph Algorithm Playground
A single-page webapp to build graphs and run algorithms on them

## Supported Graph Types
- Undirected Unweighted - Just a regular graph
- Directed Unweighted - A digraph (directed graph) with unweighted edges
- Undirected Weighted - A graph with edge weights
- Directed Weighted - A digraph with weighted edges
